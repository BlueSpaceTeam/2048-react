## Todo

- [x] The page on the desktop computer is not displayed completely.
- [x] Save progress in real time.
- [x] Add some sound effects.
- [ ] After refreshing the game page, it wouldn't back to page Home by pressing the btn home(code: `"navigate(-1)"`). Because it lost the brower history. If used code: `"navigate('/')"`, history will push two same pages which provides a bad experience while pressing browser Btn `Back`.
